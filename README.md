## 📂 Internal Project Background

This JIRA Automation framework was developed during my time at **Fizyr (Netherlands)** as an internal support optimization initiative:

- ✅ **Company:** *Fizyr, Netherlands*  
- 🧠 **Goal:** Improve ticket workflows and team response time through logic-based JIRA automation — without using paid plugins  
- 🛠️ **Scope:** Developed rule-based flows, reusable templates, and process documentation tailored for support and engineering teams

It is now open-sourced for other teams facing similar JIRA inefficiencies and looking for plug-and-play solutions.
